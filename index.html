Hi! I'm Caleigh. I'm a 4th-year <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/programs/second-degree/what-bcs-ics">
  Computer Science</a> student at the University of British Columbia. I interned with Amazon's
  <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service">Alexa Voice Service</a> and <a href="https://www.d2l.com/">
  D2L</a>, and for a long time I wrote Python on the side for the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-NLP">Natural Language
  Processing lab</a> at <a href="http://slais.ubc.ca/">iSchool@UBC</a>. Before 2016, I was a full-time learning
  strategist and got my MA in English literature.
        </p>

        <p>
Sometimes <a href="https://caleighm.github.io/blog">I like to write</a>, mostly about being a mature student in tech. I also
 like playing D&D, cooking, and trying not to kill my succulents</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Through it all I've been accompanied by <a href="http://caleighm.github.io/what-millie-ate/">my jerkface dog, Millie</a>.
