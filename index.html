          Hi! I'm Caleigh Minshall. I work at Amazon Vancouver with the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service">Alexa Voice Service</a> team.
        </p>

        <p>In 2019, I graduated from <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/programs/second-degree/what-bcs-ics">
  Computer Science</a> at the University of British Columbia. I also interned at <a href="https://www.d2l.com/">
  D2L</a> and wrote Python for the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-NLP">Natural Language
  Processing lab</a> at <a href="http://slais.ubc.ca/">iSchool@UBC</a>. Before 2016, I was a learning
  strategist and got my MA in English literature.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like playing Dungeons & Dragons, falling off bouldering problems, and trying not to kill my succulents</a>. I'm accompanied by one <a href="http://caleighm.github.io/what-millie-ate/">terrible dog</a> named Millie.
        </p>
