On Friday, I&#8217;ll officially have lived in Vancouver for a whole year &#8212; wild! I begin my co-op next Tuesday (more on that in a couple days&#8230;) and, at this point, have just 12 months of work and then 8 months of school until I&#8217;ve completed this degree.

This summer I took 3 courses. In the summer term, courses are condensed; what would ordinarily be a 12-week course in the fall or winter turns into an accelerated 6-week course in the summer. Needless to say, this was pretty tough. I wasn&#8217;t able to enjoy Vancouver&#8217;s beautiful summer as much as I&#8217;d like, but I hope to make up for it in this last week or so of freedom before I join the working world. Here is my course review for what I took this summer.

# CPSC 313: Computer Hardware and Operating Systems

This was a fun class! The first two weeks or so were simply an extension of what we learned in CPSC 213, just with a slight variation on the assembly language we used. But after that, the similarity ended. I learned a lot about memory and caching, file systems, and pipeline instructions. The assignments were tough, but we had fewer of them than in CPSC 213, so the workload didn&#8217;t feel as crazy. I wish I had taken this during the regular terms since I think we rushed through some content, but overall I found this course enjoyable and I especially liked learning about the caching and other factors that impact performance.

# CPSC 322: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

I was expecting a bit more philosophy in this course, but we spent most of the class learning a wide variety of search and constraint-solving algorithms. We practiced transforming situations into problems that our algorithms could resolve and talked a lot about the trade-offs between different approaches to a given problem. At the end, we got into some very basic Bayesian network and statistical stuff. This course felt a little light-weight; the assignments were pretty easy and I think we could have done more. The most fun part for me was when were were allowed to use any programming language we wanted to implement a constraint-solving algorithm for a given problem (naturally I chose Python).

# CPSC 320: Intermediate Algorithm Design & Analysis

Well, this course was mildly disastrous&#8230; which was too bad, because I actually found this content the most fun and interesting out of everything I took this summer! I didn&#8217;t gel especially well with the professor&#8217;s teaching or assessment style. My partner and I did very well on all of the assignments, but the midterm was a total bust. We also had a group component on the final exam, and I didn&#8217;t enjoy that aspect very much, either. I don&#8217;t feel like my grade in this course reflects my understanding at all &#8212; dynamic programming and NP-complete proofs are really fun to me! Again, I wish I&#8217;d been able to take this during the year with one of the tenured professors at UBC, but hopefully I can redeem myself when I take CPSC 420 in a year.

Overall, the summer flew by too fast! Summer courses definitely aren&#8217;t ideal &#8212; too fast and stressful, don&#8217;t actually cover everything that the fall/winter terms do &#8212; but at least we managed to blast through 9 credits in just 12 weeks. Not bad.

I plan on writing three more blogs this week about my co-op interview experiences, my teaching assistantship (?) this past term, and the directed study I&#8217;ve signed up to do this fall.

Let me know if you have any questions!
