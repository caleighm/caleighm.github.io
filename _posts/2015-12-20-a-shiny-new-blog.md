First post! I seriously considered making the title &#8220;Hello world!&#8221;, but then I thought that would be too cheesy.

Before I start diving into actual, real, juicy content, I thought I&#8217;d start things off with a couple guidelines about what this blog is.

(Although maybe these are more for me than for you.)

# Blog rules

1. This blog has **two main topics: mature students & learning to code.** Sometimes these topics will intersect; sometimes they won&#8217;t. I won&#8217;t stress it.

2. I aim to **write** **once a week**, but again &#8230; I won&#8217;t stress it.

3. I&#8217;ll **write honestly (but diplomatically!) about my experiences** as they happen, but this means that in a year&#8217;s time I might have some super cringe-worthy posts. Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.

4. **I invite feedback.** Even though this blog is about mature students, I recognize that I&#8217;m in a pretty privileged position compared to many others: I don&#8217;t have to care for a family at the same time as going to school; I&#8217;m financially stable; I already have a university degree (albeit in a totally different field than what I&#8217;m going into now). I&#8217;ll do my best to feature resources that can help students from all kinds of different backgrounds, but I hope you&#8217;ll point me back in the right direction if I ever get off track.

5. **This project should be FUN!** I am not trying to be a pro blogger. I just want to help out other people who might be considering following a path like mine. This should be a lovely little retreat from the competitive, pressure-cooker atmosphere at some undergraduate computer science programs.

So. I initially started this whole project just because I wanted to mess around with WordPress themes*, but then realized I had better come up with actual content, too. I hope you learn from my mistakes!

_*Speaking of messing around with themes &#8230; If you have any suggestions or cool things for me to try, let me know! I&#8217;ll write a post in a week or two about how I designed this theme (or scroll down to the footer if you want a spoiler). It&#8217;s definitely a work-in-progress._
