Almost done Week 2 of class! I keep a little countdown in my head. I thought I&#8217;d share how I take notes for my current course, [CISC 124 &#8211; Introduction to Computer Science II](http://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/cisc124/2015w/home.html) (Object-Oriented Programming in Java). I really like the set-up I&#8217;ve got right now.<figure id="attachment_89" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

My writing is so awful.</figcaption></figure> 

At the moment, I sit in the third row and I just bring a clipboard, a pen and some lined paper to class. This is easier to carry around than a laptop or a notebook, and I&#8217;d probably just get distracted on my laptop, anyway. With my clipboard notes, I give myself full liberty to draw crazy diagrams, write super messily, scratch things out and use up tons of space. My writing is basically illegible to anyone but myself. I try to take down only what&#8217;s important (my prof, while lovely, sometimes gets a little off-topic. She also spends a lot of time comparing Java to Python, which we learned earlier, and I don&#8217;t feel like I have to write down all those comparisons.).<figure id="attachment_90" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignright">

Colour-coded!</figcaption></figure> 

Every couple of classes, though, I re-write and organize my notes into a little notebook at home. I even try to colour-code! I find this is helpful since it forces me to review what happened in class again, and I often end up re-ordering the information from class in a way that makes more sense to me. My notes look way prettier this way, too! The best part is that when I&#8217;m done re-writing my notes, I get to rip up and throw away the old clipboard notes. It feels really satisfying.

Maybe that means I have an anger issue or something&#8230;

One thing that I haven&#8217;t figured out yet is what I want to do with my notes from my readings. In fact (gasp), I haven&#8217;t done any readings yet at all! This course is taking a little while to get going; we only just received a syllabus and schedule yesterday, and I&#8217;m still not sure where the required readings are getting posted. (The course website I linked to is from last year, and the textbook has changed.)

I imagine that I&#8217;ll take fewer notes than normal from the textbook, though, since it does seem more of a reference book than anything else. We are using _[Absolute Java](http://www.amazon.ca/Absolute-Java-Edition-Walter-Savitch/dp/0134041674)_, 6th ed. Try not to run away screaming at the $200 price tag.

Interestingly, I&#8217;ve made friends with another mature studentÂ in the class who takes far fewer notes than me. I&#8217;ve noticed that he brings unlined paper to class with a clipboard and really just writes down 7-8 lines over the course of an hour. I haven&#8217;t asked yet, but I assume he just prefers to focus on listening &#8212; and I suppose it can be a pain to copy down code examples on the slides, especially when this professor kindly posts her slides and lectures online after the fact. I have heard of some students who cope just fine without taking any notes, simply because that frees them up to pay more attention to the instructor. I know that for me, though, that&#8217;s just not an option; if I don&#8217;t take notes, I&#8217;ll start daydreaming immediately.

We have our first assignment due next week, although I&#8217;m still not sure what the assignment is yet. I&#8217;ll let you know how I set up my workspace for that when it&#8217;s done!
