    Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft. I think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won&#8217;t have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren&#8217;t even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they&#8217;re doing it.<cite>Anne Lammott, <em>Bird by Bird</em></cite>

Recently some coworkers found out I have a blog and asked for the link &#8212; and I was weirdly shy about it! (Hello, coworkers.) This is the first site I&#8217;ve made in about a decade that required writing any code. On one level I&#8217;m proud of what I&#8217;ve accomplished here so far, but on another level, I know I could have done so much better so could you please just not look at this site until I&#8217;m ready &#8230; (Picture me muttering that very quickly under my breath, because that&#8217;s basically how it happened at work.)

I&#8217;m an occasional perfectionist. There, I said it. Mostly I&#8217;ve learned to control the perfectionist monster (more on that for another day), but when it comes to public performance &#8212; harp-playing, creative writing, and, yes, designing websites &#8212; I am still awfully shy. But maybe it&#8217;s better to be upfront and own the fact that this is totally a work-in-progress, I have lots to learn, and that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not capable.

Easier said than done.

But in the interest of transparency, I&#8217;ll share the many items on my website to-do list. I&#8217;m not sure when exactly I&#8217;ll get around to solving these, but maybe you can help me?

  * Put a cute, itty-bitty search icon in the social media menu that, when clicked, has a little drop-down search bar come up. I figured out how to make this work except for how to center the search icon next to the rest of the social media menu.
  * Fix the Gravatar icon in the Comments section the does a funky thing when you hover over it. Whaaaat?
  * Fix the main navigation menu so that the links will break onto the next line when you shrink the screen (right now, the main menu always stays on one line, so there is an annoying scroll-bar when the screen shrinks).
  * Fix the way numbered lists look. The numbers spill way into the left, and it looks awkward.
  * Maybe pull out the post meta-data so that it sits to the left of the post title in a pretty way.
  * Use featured images somehow. I don&#8217;t know where or how. But I feel like that&#8217;s a thing I should have.

I&#8217;ll get around to asking these questions on &#8230; I don&#8217;t even know where I&#8217;d ask these questions yet. Stack Overflow? Is there a WordPress support community out there? There must be. I&#8217;ll let you know when I figure it out. [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com) can only help me so much.
