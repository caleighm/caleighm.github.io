Sorry for my absence these past couple weeks! One of my original goals was to post weekly, but &#8230; oh, well. Another promise I made to myself was &#8220;feel no guilt&#8221;!

What have I been up to? Well, the final exam for CISC 124 was this past Tuesday, so I was finishing upthe course&#8217;s  last two assignments and studying for the exam. My time has been taken up even more, though, by really buckling down and working with little Millie.

(As some of you know, Millie is both the joy and bane of my life: she&#8217;s smart, athletic, hilarious, and sassy, but she is also recovering from leash reactivity toward other dogs, and her crazy smarts and energy get her into trouble on the daily. Now that school has come to a close and work is wrapping up for the summer, I&#8217;ve found a wonderful trainer to help me learn how to communicate better with my pup.)

More on that later!

Today, I thought I would list a few things I&#8217;ve learned from CISC 124 this term.

# Weekly review really does make a difference

One of my initial goals for this course was to consolidate and review my lecture notes at the end of each. I did manage to do this more often than not, but I definitely noticed whenever I failed to do so &#8212; my understanding of the concepts suffered, so writing those assignments took longer. However, perhaps because I still found the course overall pretty easy, it was still tough to feel motivated enough to sit down and organize myself like this at the end of each week.

In Student Affairs, we talk a lot about &#8220;student development theory.&#8221; One popular theory is from Nevitt Sanford in 1966, who wrote about the need for a [&#8220;support/challenge balance.&#8221;](https://imjoeboe.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/challenge-support/) My experience in CISC 124 lacked sufficient challenge, so I didn&#8217;t feel as engaged in maintaining my learning strategies and habits as I could have been.

However, I do know that when I encounter a tougher course, I will really rely on this habit to keep me up-to-date and fluent with the course content!

# Sit at the front of the class

During my (first) undergraduate degree, I always sat at the back of the auditorium, or at most very solidly in the middle of the room. Sitting at the front? No way! Too exposed. Too keen. Did not allow for whispering with my friend. (Each year during my undergrad, a different prof would reprimand me for somehow being disruptive. Very embarrassing.)

But these days, I&#8217;m not as interested in whispering with my classmates and I clearly do not worry about looking keen. I also can&#8217;t hear or see as well from the back of the auditorium. In fact, I have no idea how 17-year-old me could hear or see from back there, either. What was I thinking?? To be fair, I definitely jack up the volume on my earbuds when I go for a run, so maybe my hearing has declined. Either way, though, whenever I could leave work early enough to sit in the first 2-3 rows, I did so. My notes were always better, I drifted off less, and I didn&#8217;t miss anything.

# Never buy the textbook

Okay, maybe &#8220;never&#8221; is too strong a word. But I&#8217;ve now taken two computer science courses and one mathematics course at Queen&#8217;s. Each time, the professor has recommended I buy the textbook. For CISC 124, the professor said &#8220;You definitely, definitely want the textbook.&#8221; So I dutifully went to the bookstore and spent hundreds of dollars, as requested.

Have I ever needed the books?

Nope.

Call me naive, but when a prof says &#8220;You really need this textbook in the class,&#8221; I expect to actually need the textbook in the class. Nothing from the textbook couldn&#8217;t be gleaned from the lectures. We did not get tested on anything from the textbook. I&#8217;ve done very well in all these classes &#8212; and never needed to check the book.

Now, I get that I&#8217;m not just in school here to get good grades. I should be in school for the sake of learning! But when that extra textbook learning costs hundreds of dollars on top of tuition, well&#8230; No, thanks.

Coming from a humanities background, I found class readings were crucial. Assignments, essays and tests all depended on knowing the content of the readings as well as what happened in lecture. In a pinch, maybe you could check out Wikipedia or SparkNotes &#8212; but your grades would definitely suffer for it, and you certainly wouldn&#8217;t get your money&#8217;s worth in the course.

In other news, last week I received my acceptance from Simon Fraser University. I was also admitted to Queen&#8217;s computer science program some time ago. Hopefully I&#8217;ll hear back from the University of British Columbia in early May (like I&#8217;ve read online), since I gave my landlord notice that I&#8217;m moving out at the end of June!
