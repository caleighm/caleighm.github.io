While I&#8217;m a computer science student these days, that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m any less of a bookworm. After finishing _[Here&#8217;s Looking at Euclid](http://www.amazon.ca/Heres-Looking-Euclid-Counting-Awe-Inspiring/dp/1416588280)_ (2011 and the [best math book ever](http://caleighm.com/2016/02/06/heres-looking-at-euclid-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-math/)), I picked up John Markoff&#8217;s _[Machines of Loving Grace: The Quest for Common Ground between Humans and Robots](http://www.amazon.ca/Machines-Loving-Grace-Common-Between/dp/0062266683) _(2015).

_Machines of Loving Grace_ is &#8220;a sweeping history of the complicated and evolving relationship between humans and computers&#8221; (from the book flap). It&#8217;s a little drier than _Here&#8217;s Looking at Euclid_, but I enjoy learning about the early history of computing so it&#8217;s not too bad.

But this isn&#8217;t a book review.

Instead, I was recently struck by a passage I encountered in a chapter called &#8220;Walking Away,&#8221; about a computer scientist named [Terry Winograd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Winograd). Now a professor of computer science at Stanford, Winograd started as a researcher in artificial intelligence &#8212; only to abandon that field for &#8220;intelligence augmentation,&#8221; or human-centered computing, instead (Markoff&#8217;s favourite thing to talk about is the chasm between these two competing branches of computer science). Before that happened, though, Winograd developed an influential system called [SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU) that could respond to typed commands in natural language.

Markoff&#8217;s description of SHRDLU sounded eerily familiar to me:

> [SHRDLU] was an early effort at disambiguation, a thorny problem for natural language processing even today. For example, in the sentence &#8220;he put the glass on the table and it broke,&#8221; does &#8220;it&#8221; refer to the glass or the table? Without more context, neither a human nor an AI program could decide. <cite>Markoff, p. 176</cite>

After a minute or two of thinking, I realized why this sounded so familiar &#8212; I&#8217;ve taught pronoun disambiguation before! Occasionally the Writing Centre needs my help in delivering writing workshops, and last term I taught 5 or 6 workshops to English 100 students at Queen&#8217;s on how to write effective papers. Pronoun disambiguation was a major topic, and effective writers avoid it like the plague (much like they are supposed to avoid cliches).

I&#8217;ve long wondered if somehow my background in English literature is directly contributing to my success so far in computer science classes, and maybe this is a clue. I think that when people learn how to write well &#8212; clearly, unambiguously articulate their ideas to a specific audience &#8212; those skills can pretty easily transfer to writing computer programs. My guess is that the same students who struggle with communicating their thoughts in writing will likely struggle with programming, too &#8212; and students who have learned to program well, or write well, should be able to translate those skills into clear writing or programming, respectively.

Weirdly, this is the second time in two days that I&#8217;ve encountered this idea. A friend of mine in the computer science program recently directed me to [How to Design Programs](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/). Check out this bit from the preface:

> &#8230; [P]rogram design teaches the same analytical reading and writing skills as English. Even the smallest design tasks are formulated as word problems. Without critical reading skills, you cannot design programs that solve the problem and match its specifications. Conversely, program design methods force you to articulate their thoughts in proper and precise English. Indeed, **our observations suggests that if you truly absorb the design recipe, you will develop your articulation skills more than anything else**. <cite><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/part_preface.html">&#8220;Preface&#8221;</a> from <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/">How to Design Programs</a></cite>

I completely agree, and this echoes my rambling conversations that I&#8217;ve had with other writing consultants at my work and some of the STEM educators I met at the [Canadian Celebration of Women in Computing conference](http://caleighm.com/2016/01/24/thoughts-on-my-first-canadian-celebration-of-women-in-computing-2016/) this past January. While STEM educators worry about teaching STEM, and writing and rhetoric educators worry about teaching writing and rhetoric, I am looking incredulously at each side and wondering &#8220;Why the heck aren&#8217;t these instructors talking to each other more?&#8221;

Perhaps none of this comes as a surprise to you. I&#8217;m glad if that&#8217;s the case. Yet I have spoken to so many arts and humanities students (English literature and beyond) who don&#8217;t think they can learn computer science, and it seems to me that many computer science students share disdain for &#8216;fluffy,&#8217; non-computer science or mathematics topics. (I&#8217;m not as certain of the latter since I don&#8217;t know as many computer science students, but that has been my experience in working with some engineering students, for example).

In reality, though, the fields seem to foster the same skills &#8212; the ability to read and understand texts, and to articulate your ideas with precision!

I am definitely not an expert in any of this. I don&#8217;t teach computer science, and I don&#8217;t teach writing (well, sometimes I teach writing, but not usually). These are just my impressions, and maybe there are some amazing organizations already doing this kind of work of which I&#8217;m just unaware. But I do wonder &#8230;

How many students are missing out on some really exciting breadth and knowledge because they think they&#8217;re incapable, or that the other field is irrelevant or too different from what they&#8217;re used to? Also, are STEM or writing instructors missing out on some valuable insights from each other, because they too assume the practices are too different? Is there a way to tie together clear writing skills with good program design? Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if more of our computer scientists could write and read as effectively as our English majors, and if more of our English majors knew how to program and think like a computer scientist?

I&#8217;ll leave you with the poem that gave Markoff&#8217;s book its title. I think this is [Richard Brautigan&#8217;s](http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/sep/23/prose-poetry-brilliance-of-richard-brautigan) most famous poem &#8212; a lot of different things are named after it &#8212; and it&#8217;s so, so good.

**All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace**

_by Richard Brautigan_

I like to think (and
  
the sooner the better!)
  
of a cybernetic meadow
  
where mammals and computers
  
live together in mutually
  
programming harmony
  
like pure water
  
touching clear sky.

I like to think
  
(right now, please!)
  
of a cybernetic forest
  
filled with pines and electronics
  
where deer stroll peacefully
  
past computers
  
as if they were flowers
  
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think
  
(it has to be!)
  
of a cybernetic ecology
  
where we are free of our labors
  
and joined back to nature,
  
returned to our mammal
  
brothers and sisters,
  
and all watched over
  
by machines of loving grace.
