    I have officially been in Vancouver for nearly a month &#8211; holy smokes! Class started on September 7 and I&#8217;ve now written one test, two long assignments, and 5+ quizzes/weekly math/stats short assignments. Time flies. UBC is much more challenging than Queen&#8217;s, and the work never seems to end!

  I only wanted to check in now just to reassure you that Millie and I have survived the journey and settling into our new home. I&#8217;ve even made a couple new friends and have experienced (so far) one crisis in confidence (I expect that count to increase&#8230;).

  * review of all my courses this term
  * differences between studying discrete math vs calculus
  * how I make summary sheets
  * how not to fall asleep during \*excruciatingly boring\* texts &#8230;
  * differences between UBC, UVic and Queen&#8217;s
  * how to combat homesickness
  * a couple book reviews, too!
