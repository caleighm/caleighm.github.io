![Our wedding in June 2018]({{ site.url }}/public/posts/2018-08-03-wedding.jpg)

It's been a long time since I've written anything on this blog, and I suspect it'll be a long time until I write another after this one! After some health emergencies, a wedding, and a rewnewed commitment to the Important Things in Life, I'm retiring this blog (for now) (if you hadn't already noticed by the lack of posts). But before going on hiatus completely, here's a look at the past 8 months and what's to come:

# So, what happened?
- Like I mentioned above, my little family continues to work through some scary health issues
- I withdrew from my commitments at the iSchool's Natural Language Processing lab so that I could focus on the above health issues instead
- I completed a wonderful 8-month co-op at [D2L](https://www.d2l.com/), where I learned a lot about web development in C#, JavaScript, and polymer web components
- I got married on June 2, 2018! :)
- I started another, also wonderful 3-month co-op with Amazon's [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service) here in Vancouver where I learned a lot about Java, C++, Java Native Interface, and Android mobile development
- I completed that 3-month co-op, too, and have a return offer to consider

# And what's coming up?
- I have 7 courses left before I can graduate from the BCS program in April 2019: CPSC 317, CPSC 418, CPSC 430, CPSC 310, CPSC 304, ADHE 3xx, CRWR 2xx
- I'm trying to take as light a course load as possible in case those scary health issues decide to cause mayhem
- I'm relaxing for the month of August!
- I am looking around at Vancouver tech companies to figure out what comes next upon graduation

In time I may take up blogging again. Who knows? I know I definitely want to fix whatever's going on with the commenting.
