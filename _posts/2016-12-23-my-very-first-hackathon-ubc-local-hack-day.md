After a wicked snow day resulting in a [cancelled final exam](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5j6lp6/ubc_weather_advisory_830am_point_grey_exams/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=UBC), the unexpectedly highest GPA of my life (so much for &#8220;not being a math person&#8221;), and abandoning my darling doggo to a Vancouver kennel (my heart breaks for her), I am finally nestled in snowy Ontario with family for a short winter break. I promised in my last post that I would write a little more often while I had the chance, so I thought I&#8217;d share my experiences at my very first hackathon, UBC&#8217;s [Local Hack Day](https://localhackday.mlh.io/) on December 3, 2016.

UBC Local Hack Day is part of the Major League Hacking (MLH) Local Hack Days happening worldwide. Instead of the more typical grungy 24- or 48-hour coding sprint, MLH Local Hack Days are a humane 12 hours long &#8212; much better! The organizers provided us with free snacks and pizza, and I even got some shiny new stickers for my laptop:<figure id="attachment_234" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Major League Hacking (MLH) encourages high schools and universities around the world to organize their own Local Hack Day, and UBC hosted one of them. At the same time that I was plunking away at my laptop in Vancouver, BC, students all over the world were doing the same thing. MLH representatives were at some of the larger schools &#8212; I think they were in New York, for example &#8212; interviewing attendees and generally sharing upbeat quotations and photos. It was pretty fun and lighthearted.

I had the option of joining a team and presenting my final project at the end of the hackathon, but I chose not to. Part of the Hack Day&#8217;s appeal was its non-competitive, celebratory and beginner-friendly atmosphere &#8212; I wanted the chance to hunker down and work on a personal project in a dedicated environment, without any pressure to actually finish, so that I could continue working on it post-hackathon (indeed, I&#8217;ve spent most of today working on it! More on this later.). The introductory speeches included quite a lot of talk about the [MLH code of conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf) and kindness, which I appreciated.

A few speakers stopped by. [Susan Ibach](https://twitter.com/HockeyGeekGirl), a Tech Evangelist from Microsoft, was back to talk about Azure and, like the last time I saw her speak, was pretty hilarious. Some students from the [UBC Game Developers&#8217; Association](http://blogs.ubc.ca/ubcgda/about/) gave a helpful talk about version control and GitHub.

In hindsight, I feel like I could have gotten even more out of the event, but I just got too excited by, well, _coding_. Instead of taking the time to learn from the talks, or chat with the professional mentors, I put my head down and worked for about 11 hours straight. My head was spinning by the end! I think an important aspect of these events, especially since I wasn&#8217;t aiming to win a competition, is simply found in the networking. I completely missed that part.

My biggest regret is not staying to hear my peers&#8217; presentations, but I just couldn&#8217;t tolerate sitting in that auditorium any longer. Hack Day went from 9am to 9pm; I left at around 7:45pm, right before the presentations began. I needed a break (and a shower).

My next hackathon is the [Vancouver Game Jam](http://www.ggjvancouver.com/) in January, which is more traditional in length (48 hours!) and definitely team-based. I hope to learn a lot at this one since I&#8217;ve never actually developed a game before, but after my experience at UBC Local Hack Day, I also know the importance of taking regular breaks.
