Alright, it&#8217;s official &#8211; last week I was admitted to and paid my deposit for the [University of British Columbia&#8217;s BCS (ICS) second-degree program](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/programs/second-degree/what-bcs-ics), starting this fall. eek!

Despite my endless worries about moving across the country with a hyper little dog, to a city where I know all of two people, I think this is the right choice. For one thing, it&#8217;s only a 20-month program excluding the co-op. For another, UBC is one of the best computer science schools in Canada. And, last but not least, the program is specifically for mature students who&#8217;ve already got a bachelor degree in another field &#8212; meaning my peers won&#8217;t be straight out of high school! I&#8217;m hopeful that this means I&#8217;ll make friends a little more easily in the program and feel less isolated than I have at Queen&#8217;s, for example.

I&#8217;ve got my work lined up for me this summer, though. My last day working at Queen&#8217;s is June 9. I have to say goodbye to all my favourite Kingston restaurants (and, okay, my friends&#8230;) in the next month or so. The going-away party is June 18. All my stuff needs to be sold and I&#8217;ve got to be out of Kingston by June 23. I&#8217;ve enrolled in a serious dog-training course in Toronto this summer to work on Millie&#8217;s reactivity. I&#8217;m going to work through the free, online version of UBC&#8217;s first-year computing course in the hopes that I can skip it and move on to more advanced stuff when I get there (called [&#8220;How to Code &#8211; Systematic Program Design&#8221; at edX](https://www.edx.org/xseries/how-code-systematic-program-design) &#8212; and it&#8217;s taught in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)! so cool! Also the course is based on _[How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org/)_, which [I&#8217;ve written about before](http://caleighm.com/2016/02/20/common-ground-between-english-literature-and-computing/)). I&#8217;ve also met a nice person (thanks, universe!), so I am trying to visit them lots before I move to British Columbia.

Anyway, all of this is to say that I expect my blogging will slow down over the summer as I wait for the real work to start in September. I may blog a little bit about my experiences with edX and possibly even dog training (since we can learn a lot about how we learn from how dogs learn).

It feels pretty good to have settled on some kind of future for the next 2-3 years! And, for the record, I did really well in the winter computer science course on object-oriented programming, so I am proud of that.
