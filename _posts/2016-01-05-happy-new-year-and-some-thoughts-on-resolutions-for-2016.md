Ordinarily I&#8217;m pretty contrarian when it comes to making resolutions. &#8220;Well,&#8221; I grumble, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really believe in making new year resolutions. Did you know [only 8% of people even achieve their resolutions](http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/) in a given year?!&#8221; (I am not especially fun at NYE parties. This year my friends had to wake me up ten minutes before midnight so I wouldn&#8217;t miss the countdown.)

But then today I thought, &#8220;New year, new blog &#8212; maybe it&#8217;s time to make a resolution or two!&#8221; I&#8217;m going to aim low on most of these in hopes that one or two will survive the next 360 days (because it&#8217;s already January 5th! Being punctual is not one of my resolutions.)

# 1. Re-write, review and organize lecture notes twice per week

I&#8217;m enrolled in my first university lecture course since 2009, and this terrifies me*. I know one great way to stay on top of schoolwork, though, is [to review and re-organize my notes regularly](http://hilt.harvard.edu/files/hilt/files/notetaking_0.pdf?m=1413398930). Right now my set-up is to bring a clipboard and lined paper to class, sit close to the front, and take lots of notes &#8212; and then, when it&#8217;s time to review, I&#8217;ll summarize, re-organize and re-write those notes much more neatly in a notebook. I kind of look forward to this ritual, actually, since it&#8217;s a nice, low-pressure excuse to think about things with a cup of tea.

_* will fearlessly examine this terror in a future post, don&#8217;t worry._

# 2. Practice the harp every day (unless I&#8217;m out of town)

I&#8217;ve tried a couple different methods to keep myself on top of harp practice. I&#8217;ve tried marking it on a calendar, in an agenda, tying my harp practice to tea time, timing myself, aiming for &#8220;four hours per week&#8221;. I&#8217;m going to try something new: every day, I have to practice &#8212; doesn&#8217;t matter how long or how little. There&#8217;s also no expectation of improving (trying not to stress out more than school will allow). But at the very least, I have to sit down at the harp and play a bit. Every. Day. (Until 2017.)

My hope is that this drastic measure will force me to stop rationalizing why I can&#8217;t practice.

&#8230;Of course, one teeny-weeny-eensy rationalization remains for now: I need to replace a string! But once that&#8217;s replaced, I promise, I&#8217;ll start.

# 3. Watch one [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com) video tutorial per week

One thing I&#8217;ve started to learn from my research into various computer science and programming educational opportunities is that the field is always, always changing. As soon as you think you&#8217;re on top of things, BAM! you are obsolete and have to learn an entirely new language or framework or device. I want to get into the habit of continual learning now.

The other thing I&#8217;m increasingly starting to feel is that, while the university courses are great for general concepts, if I want to learn specific, practical skills, I&#8217;ll have to look elsewhere. So one Lynda.com video per week should help me with this. (And hey, it&#8217;s free while I&#8217;m an employee or student here, so I might as well take advantage of it!)

# 4. Write in my journal once per week

This resolution is pretty personal. I find I only write in my journal when I&#8217;m upset: broken heart, confusing crossroads, general crippling feelings of inadequacy&#8230; And I soon feel better when I write about these things! But I think that I should a) reflect more about my decisions and daily habits, and b) show more gratitude about all the good things in my life.

# 5. Be able to do ten push-ups!

I stole this one from one of my NYE friends. The one who had to wake me up for the countdown, in fact.

* * *

Each of these resolutions is specific, measurable (once per week, ten push-ups), realistic, and has a timed component to put a little fire under my butt (weekly, by the end of the year). That meets the SMART goal requirement, I think!

Four resolutions seems like a lot. I&#8217;ll write a progress report in 1 month.

And here&#8217;s a poem about being cool with yourself, just the way you are without any resolutions at all, to get you through the rest of the week: [&#8220;Antilamentation&#8221; by Dorianne Laux](http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2011/03/07).
