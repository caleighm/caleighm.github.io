I&#8217;ll admit that my plans to blog weekly fell through in a pretty big way this term. My last exam is tomorrow morning (possibly I should be studying), but for all the potential BCS applicants out there, I did want to at least write a review of the 4 courses I&#8217;ve taken this term and my general impression of the program so far. I&#8217;ve got a couple weeks off over Christmas, too, so I hope to share more about what I got up to over the last three months during that time.

One of the very first things that UBC tells you about the BCS program is that

> &#8220;We expect that, for many participants, the first eight months of the BCS (ICS) program will be an **intense and challenging** experience, immersing students in new ways of thinking, creating, and communicating.&#8221;

Emphasis mine. And they aren&#8217;t kidding.

I worked harder in the last four months than I did during my undergraduate or MA degrees. It was exhausting. For the first 8 weeks, particularly, I kept my head down and &#8212; apart from being out with Millie for 1-2 hours per day &#8212; essentially did homework and readings from morning until about 8pm at night, every day. I wasn&#8217;t even in the most labour-intensive course (that award has to go to CPSC 110, from which I was fortunately exempted). But the transition from a humanities background to a fast-paced, problem-solving environment &#8212; with labs, assignments, readings, quizzes and problem sets due every week &#8212; was a tough transition for me.

There have been moments of despair! Several moments, actually. Nobody talked much about this during the limited orientation we got to the program, but I went through (and am still going through&#8230;) a shock very similar to what I witnessed in first-years at Queen&#8217;s: the realization that just because we were pretty smart and capable back home, we aren&#8217;t necessarily going to get those same results here. (MATH 200, I&#8217;m looking at you.) All of the friends I&#8217;ve made here in Vancouver felt the same, at some point or another, although we only started sharing these dark feelings later in the term as we got to know each other better.

So, if you&#8217;re currently in the BCS program and feeling like garbage, let me tell you: you&#8217;re not alone. You&#8217;ll get through it!

(This is partly a pep talk on my behalf, too, in advance of final grades coming out in a week or two.)

If you&#8217;re curious about what exactly I took this term, here we go:

# CPSC 121: Formal Models of Computation

This turned out to be my favourite course this term! We did a pretty fun variety of things in this class: playing with circuit boards in the lab, discrete math, easy proofs, propositional logic, weak and strong induction, the very, very basics of a working computer &#8230; I found the learning curve tough at the beginning. We had clicker questions in lecture, and I often felt like I was the only person out of everyone I sat with who struggled to get the right answer. Labs also occasionally drove me nuts; our labs always came together by the end of the session, but sometimes it was a struggle to figure out the wiring on our circuit board.

However, by the end of the course, I really started enjoying it. Proofs are great. Propositional logic is great. Hell, I find proving the validity of propositional logic statements very soothing, now. It felt like solving puzzles in its purest form! We did zero coding during the course, but we did examine algorithms to a small extent, and apparently this gets expanded on in CPSC 221 (which I&#8217;m taking next term).

The workload felt high at the beginning while I was still getting my bearings, but by the end of the course, it felt manageable. There&#8217;s a weekly lab, a weekly online quiz, 5 assignments (each one took me between 4-8 hours to do), two midterms, and a final exam.

# STAT 200 &#8211; Elementary Statistics for Applications

I found STAT 200 very sneaky. For the first 6 weeks, it felt like my bird course: different types of experiments, parameters versus statistics, the very basics of probability, normal and uniform distributions. So far, so good. Things quickly escalated after the halfway point. I couldn&#8217;t even tell you exactly what was hard about it &#8212; the math was easy &#8212; but I found it tricky to apply the correct formula to a complex word problem. I wish I spent much more time on this class; the early weeks lulled me into a false sense of security. In hindsight, I wish I attended the professor&#8217;s office hours to clarify the concepts early on.

STAT 200 has a reputation for being an easy course, and I don&#8217;t know if I agree yet or not. It felt easy at the beginning, but we&#8217;ll see how the final went. (To be fair, I also had the stomach flu that day.) We had 2 assignments, weekly labs, a couple webwork questions per week, a midterm, and a final.

# MATH 200 &#8211; Multivariable Calculus (Calculus III)

This course was a roller coaster of emotions. I spent almost every day doing practice problems, studying for the quizzes, or trying to get through the webwork each week. I got 3/9 on the first quiz (and contemplated dropping out of UBC and moving back home). Then I did much better on the next 5 quizzes. I also did very well on the midterm (especially considering our section&#8217;s average was 47% before scaling).

And then&#8230; the final. Oh, the final. It was tragic. I went into the final with an A in the class, but I blew a couple easy questions (I&#8217;ve come to realize I choke under math pressure!), so I am not feeling too great about my grade, barring scaling. I did well in Calculus I and II, but spherical and cylindrical coordinates escape me.

Unless visualizing three-dimensional shapes comes easily to you (and it certainly did not to me), you&#8217;ll probably find this course a lot of work to wrap your head around. It&#8217;s not an impossible course &#8212; previous grade distributions show that quite a few students wind up with 80 and 90+ grades (and a lot of students get under 60) &#8212; but I think, for those of us who can&#8217;t picture the shapes easily, the course remains un-intuitive and difficult. Part of it was the fast pace, for me &#8212; given more time to think about the material each week, I think I would have found it a lot easier. But our professor moved like lightening!

In this course, we had weekly web work, six quizzes, one midterm, and one final.

# COGS 200 &#8211; Introduction to Cognitive Systems

Finally, COGS 200. I don&#8217;t even really know where to begin with this one. This course was all about the theory and design of cognitive systems, or artificial intellingence, and what that might tell us about our own consciousness, to.

It&#8217;s interdisciplinary, so we had three professors &#8212; a philosopher, a linguist, and a computer scientist &#8212; take turns lecturing the material. Coming from English literature, the philosophy and linguistics components were interesting but also pretty straightforward. The computer science was new to me, but I didn&#8217;t feel like the professor had enough time to share much in-depth or thought-provoking material.

The real doozy is the group work. 45% of your final grade ultimately comes from a research proposal that you and your three assigned group members have to come up with, research, and write. Our group did very well, but I often found it stressful balancing our different goals for the course as well as different experience levels in academic research (first-years could take COGS 200, after all). If you wind up with a terrible group, well, this course will not be very fun for you.

We had three individual written assignments (mainly short-answer questions, not research papers), a group midterm (terrible), a 1-page research proposal introduction, class presentation and poster, the final 5-page proposal, and a final exam.

Hope you found these course reviews helpful. Back to studying for CPSC 121 &#8212; wish me luck!
