Lately a lot of [BCS](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/programs/second-degree/what-bcs-ics) applicants have been emailing me after finding this blog to ask about the program and what computer science (specifically BCS) at UBC is really like. One common refrain is "What's co-op like?" And that's a *great* question, since co-op is kind of crazy.

Before I get into this, you should first check out BCS's [official info](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/programs/second-degree/bcs-co-op-program) on the topic as well as the [UBC Science Co-op website](http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/) (note that the rules for BCS students are different from the rules for regular undergrads). I'm just a student at UBC, so definitely do your research! What's coming up is just my personal experience so far -- *not* UBC gospel.

# What is a co-op?
Co-op is when you take a semester (or two, or three) away from classes to work full-time at a company in your field -- in our case, software development. Yes, you get paid! Yes, you get academic credit! ...Yes, you have to pay tuition. :(

# Why do a co-op?
It's pretty recommended in computer science to do a co-op, because the work experience will a) teach you tons of stuff you'd never learn sitting in lecture, and b) will look awesome on your resume.

At UBC, co-op is totally optional. You don't have to do it if you don't want to. In fact, I know a few BCS students who decided not to do co-op at all. This could be for a variety of reasons: they want to graduate faster, they don't want to spend the money on co-op workshops/tuition, and/or they want to find internships on their own. These are all valid reasons!

If you're hesitating about co-op in BCS, ask the upper-years and see what their experiences are like.

For me, I kind of liked the extra support that the formal co-op program provided (more on that in the next section).

# What's co-op like at UBC?
At UBC, if you formally do the co-op program, you also get this noted on your diploma once you graduate. That's kind of cool. What's extra cool about the CS co-op program at UBC is that you also get a lot of support from the co-op staff in terms of building a resume and cover letter as well as your interviewing skills. You also get access to the jobs board!

Doing the formal co-op starts far in advance of actually applying for positions. At least when I did it in 2016, within two months of arriving at UBC for the BCS program I had to submit my application to the co-op office -- just to get *admitted* to the formal co-op program, not for an actual job! This was a pretty easy and straightforward written application as well as my (extremely *non*-technical at that point) resume. 

After that, I had a quick 20-minute interview with one of the co-op coordinators. My understanding is that in this admission process, the co-op coordinators look at your transcript, maturity and communication skills, and expectations and interest in the co-op program.

I only know one BCS student who wasn't admitted to the co-op program in September, and it was for administrative/transfer credit issues entirely beyond her control. She applied the following term and got in. :)

You find out whether you're admitted to the co-op program in the fall term, and then in the winter term you attend a series of workshops on resume and cover letter skills, co-op rules and expectations, technical interview skills, and general "how to be a decent employee". I found all of these workshops, except the technical interview workshop, kind of basic -- like many BCS students, I had an entire career and several years of work experience before coming to UBC. I know how to write a professional email...

(The technical interview workshop was *fantastic*, though!)

# How long is co-op?
The other big decision you'll have to make is how long you want your co-ops to be. In BCS, the "dream scenario" is that you're in school for 12 months, do a 4-month co-op, then 4 months of school, then another 4-month co-op, and then a final 4 months of school and you get to graduate. Easy peasy!

Unfortunately, most 4-month co-ops are highly competitive and as a new student seeking your first co-op, it could be tough to get a good 4-month co-op where you're not just doing automated testing all the time. So you might opt to do an 8-month co-op, which are more common and typically ensure you'll get to do more interesting work.

I chose to do an 8-month co-op. So my BCS schedule looks like this:
- 12 months of school
- 8 months of co-op in one placement
- 4 months of co-op in another placement
- 8 months of school
- Graduate!!! (I can't wait...)

# What's the job application process like?
Applying for jobs starts in late April/early May. You have to apply through UBC's co-op job board, but you'll get more information on that during the winter term workshops.

I was most surprised at the sheer number of CS internships available. Coming from a humanities background, where there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth over job prospects for English majors, there are a *lot* more postings for software development co-ops. 

Your co-op coordinator will advise you as to how many applications you should be making per week, depending on how competitive you are at the time (remember, as a BCS student, if you are applying for September-start co-ops, you'll have only taken 3-4 CS courses at the time of applying). Folks often find the first co-op the hardest to nail, but subsequent application periods will feel much easier for you!

After 3-4 companies didn't bother interviewing me at all, I received two interviews within about 48 hours of each other and got offers from both. I decided to work at D2L, an educational technology company, for 8 months from September 2017-April 2018 (more on this place later!). Although I wish the UBC co-op office didn't pressure students so much to take the first offer they get -- I was done with job applications in, like, 4 days and will never know what might have been with the remainder of my applications -- I am really happy at D2L so everything worked out for the best.

For my next blog, I hope to write a little more about what it's actually like being a co-op at D2L. 

Hope you found this helpful, BCSers!
