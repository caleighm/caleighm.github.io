I wrote my last exam yesterday (April 25) and fully intended to write a new blog (seeing as it&#8217;s so out of date) &#8230; only to realize I drafted this one some time ago, but never published!

Tomorrow I&#8217;ll write about my experiences at nwHacks, preparing for co-op applications, and a term 2 review of the BCS program. Hope you find this helpful, future BCSers!

I&#8217;ve officially completed my second hackathon! The [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) &#8212; I was at the one in Vancouver &#8212; is an amazing, 48-hour game dev bonanza in which artists, devs, designers, you-name-it all come together for a glorious weekend of coffee, coding, and calamity. (Calamity, like when my team and I realized that our game&#8217;s baddies defied the laws of physics and started flying uncontrollably around the screen when we accidentally adjusted the gravity settings.)

This hackathon was so. much. fun. A friend from the BCS program and I formed a team along with two other UBC students we randomly met in the registration line-up. None of us had much programming experience, the two other students weren&#8217;t even majoring in CS, but it was &#8220;ride or die&#8221; from about 7pm on Friday night until Sunday at 3pm.

We settled on using JavaScript and the [Phaser game dev framework](https://phaser.io/) using the JetBrains WebStorm IDE. Phaser is a free open source HTML5 game dev framework that has a pretty fantastic community and regular newsletter that I&#8217;ve been reading ever since. They also have [many cool, actual game examples](https://phaser.io/examples) of Phaser features, like how to use sprites, create scenes, do fun things with their arcade physics, and much more. I found these examples, and their quick tutorial, an intuitive and inspiring way to get to know the framework &#8230; at first. Unfortunately, Phaser&#8217;s biggest flaw is that its official documentation is quite sparse. Want to look up a method to see what it does and what its parameters are? Cool! Find it in the docs! &#8230; But frequently the docs would only give you the name of the method and the names of its parameters &#8212; no description of what it was for, what the parameters or options meant, etc. It made debugging a pretty frustrating experience at times &#8212; we essentially learned the entire platform by looking at the given examples and experimenting a lot.

The other downside to Phaser was that basically everyone else at the hackathon opted to use the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/) instead, so we couldn&#8217;t ask others for help. There was one other group that used Phaser (and they came up with a fantastic and hilarious multiplayer game called Whales Hate Birds), but they were also new to the framework and, in fact, made up of fellow BCS students! So while we chatted a bit, we couldn&#8217;t help each other too much since both of our groups were new to Phaser.

On the other hand, I feel comfortable enough in Phaser &#8212; and its online community is friendly enough &#8212; that I think I could make my own game by myself now, which is neat! I don&#8217;t think of myself as a gamer (in spite of many years in middle and high school avoiding my problems with MMORPGs &#8230;), but game development requires such a fun combination of creativity, technical skill, and story-telling that I really got addicted. If I meet any artsy/designer friends in Vancouver (I now realize that good art and design is the key to a polished game &#8212; we had to get our sprite sheets from the web), I would totally make a game as a fun personal project.

The most fun part of all, though, was getting to know the other hackathon attendees and feeling inspired by their amazing creations. 48 hours allowed us enough time to mingle and explore other projects, and wow &#8212; they were all so cool! One game required the player to use the pitch/tone of their voice to navigate the character. Another game was a sumo wrestling simulation where the players had to shift their weight on a balance board to &#8216;bump&#8217; off their opponent. A few teams also played with some neat virtual reality hardware. Everybody was so creative and had so much fun; the jam&#8217;s theme was &#8220;waves,&#8221; so some people ran with that, but others just did their own thing and rocked it anyway (like we did). There&#8217;s something really special about a ton of people giving up a whole weekend to create stuff with the sole purpose of spreading joy and silliness.

What was our game, you ask? We called it Squirrel Adventure: you play a perky little squirrel just trying to collect some acorns on UBC&#8217;s Main Mall (the busiest road on campus) while evil cyclists and longboarders are hellbent on running you over during classroom rush hour. In theory, sounds pretty cool; in practice, our graphics were preeeetty amateur since we didn&#8217;t have an artist, and our game mechanics accidentally turned into &#8220;Super Mario 2D platformer&#8221; because that was the easiest to implement. We bit off way more than we could chew!

Fortunately, my team decided to stay healthy and fresh, so we always went to bed at decent times and ate regularly. Other teams stayed overnight (I don&#8217;t think I could handle that). This meant I was ready to start up at school the following week without lagging too much.

We didn&#8217;t manage to deploy the game, so I can&#8217;t share it with you yet, although one of my team members and I plan to figure that out after we&#8217;re done our exams in April. Overall, I learned a lot more about JavaScript, working in a team of programmers, version control using git, and the importance of &#8220;planning first, coding later&#8221; (learned that the hard way this time around). I definitely plan on returning to Vancouver Game Jam 2018 &#8212; hopefully with a bigger skill set and maybe even a sleeping bag!
