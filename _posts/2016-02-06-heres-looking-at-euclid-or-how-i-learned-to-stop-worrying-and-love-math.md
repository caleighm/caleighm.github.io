I don&#8217;t have a typical blog post for you today. This is more of a rhapsodic book review. But first, some back story &#8230;

I did not grow up thinking of myself as &#8220;a math person.&#8221; The opposite, in fact. I have unfortunately vivid memories of ignoring the homework, failing the tests, and then being lucky enough to have a sympathetic teacher who would always let me re-take it so I could pass. I dropped math like a hot potato as soon as I could (which, in Ontario, is after grade 11).

I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m not the only one who felt that way.

I have a lot of theories as to why this was so, at least in my case. Firstly, no one in my family has anything to do with math, so I didn&#8217;t have any personal role models or anyone who could help me with homework if I ran into trouble. Secondly, I never felt a strong connection with any of my math teachers (all men, too) &#8212; it&#8217;s no coincidence that the class I loved most, English, was taught by the teachers with whom I bonded most (hi, Doc Evans, Doc Sumner and Mr. Nugent!). Finally, I also didn&#8217;t have a lot of friends in high school, and my grade 11 math class especially was full of kids I had come to dread. I remember sort of just hunkering down at my desk and watching the clock &#8217;til the period ended.

But now that I&#8217;m venturing into computer science, &#8220;not being a math person&#8221; is no longer an option.

Fortunately, after some time and distance from high school drama, I&#8217;m not scared of math any more. Last winter I took grade 12 Advanced Functions and Calculus through the [Independent Learning Centre (ILC)](http://www.ilc.org/), and in the summer I took Queen&#8217;s MATH 121, a first-year differential and integral calculus course. They all went surprisingly well!

And yet I still find myself being a little, well, _nervous_ around math. Sort of like I don&#8217;t belong. A throwback, maybe, to when I felt socially excluded in my high school math class &#8212; except now it&#8217;s like I feel intellectually excluded by the entire field of mathematics itself (how&#8217;s _that_ for melodramatic anthropomorphism?). When writing or reading, I feel at home, comfortable, and ready to take on any new theorist or text (my MA essay was on [Jacques Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida), for pete&#8217;s sake), but when I think about taking a more advanced math class, I still hear a little doubting voice: &#8220;Do you _really_ think you can do this?&#8221; Intellectually I know this is silly, but emotionally it&#8217;s disheartening.

**But how can I boost my math confidence or sense of belonging? **This seems separate, somehow, from simply boosting my knowledge and practice of mathematics; I did well in the courses, so surely my knowledge is pretty good. It&#8217;s as if I have to shift my emotional relationship with math, instead. But how?

Enter _[Here&#8217;s Looking at Euclid: A Surprising Excursion through the Astonishing World of Math](http://www.amazon.ca/Heres-Looking-Euclid-Counting-Awe-Inspiring/dp/1416588280)_ by Alex Bellos.

I picked up this gem of a book from Kingston&#8217;s public library. Published in 2010, _Here&#8217;s Looking at Euclid_ shares Bellos&#8217;s lighthearted international journey through some of the most intriguing chapters of mathematics&#8217; cultural history. It&#8217;s like an adult, non-fiction version of [_The Phantom Tollbooth_ by Norman Juster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Tollbooth) on steroids &#8212; which is to say, _Here&#8217;s Looking at Euclid_ is AWESOME.

Steeped in a humanities background, I&#8217;ve found so much more to love and appreciate about mathematics in this book, because I&#8217;m finally starting to understand the connections between the math I&#8217;ve studied recently and the history, philosophy, and religions courses I studied in the past. To me, math always felt like this highly abstract, isolated field of study, like something found frozen at the peak of a mountain, ahistoric and eternal &#8212; but of course that&#8217;s not the case! Like everything else, math has evolved differently around the world, and almost every feature I take for granted (like our decimal system, the number zero, or the way I was taught to do multiplication) was actually invented by a person or culture for a particular purpose.

I&#8217;ve learned too many interesting things to list them all here, but one of my favourite chapters is about an Indian mathematician named [Bharati Krishna Tirthaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Bharati_Krishna_Tirtha#Mathematics) who discovered some arithmetical tricks now known as Vedic mathematics. This is my favourite paragraph about him:

> Tirthaji promoted Vedic mathematics as a gift to the nation&#8230;. Due to Tirthaji&#8217;s moral authority and charisma as a public speaker, audiences loved him. The general public, he wrote, were &#8220;highly impressed, nay, thrilled, wonder-struck and flabbergasted!&#8221; at Vedic mathematics. To those who asked whether the method was math or magic, he had a set reply: **&#8220;It is both. It is magic until you understand it; and it is mathematics thereafter.&#8221;** <cite>Bellos in Here&#8217;s Looking at Euclid, p. 83</cite>

That&#8217;s how I feel about math every day, Tirthaji. (I also like how _he&#8217;s_ the one who wrote how flabbergasted and highly impressed his audiences were &#8230; What a modest dude. Also the quotation nicely foreshadows [Arthur C. Clarke&#8217;s third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws), which is &#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221;)

At first I was surprised by how much this book improved my confidence and feelings toward math, but upon reflection, it makes total sense. We learn best when we connect new information to things that we already know and understand (the fancy term for this is &#8220;elaborative rehearsal,&#8221; and [a lot](http://www.teachthought.com/uncategorized/why-brain-based-learning-means-always-connecting-old-knowledge-with-new/) [is written](http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/107006/chapters/Memory,_Learning,_and_Test-Taking_Success.aspx) [about](http://www.edutopia.org/neuroscience-brain-based-learning-relevance-improves-engagement) [this](http://www.project2061.org/publications/sfaa/online/chap13.htm) [already](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~kihlstrm/GSI_2011.htm), both informally and academically). So, in my case, having a very humanities-heavy background, I can improve my comfort level with mathematics by connecting it to my prior knowledge of and enthusiasm for world history, religious studies, and literature.

How does all of this relate to computer science or being a mature student? Well, I&#8217;ve come to respect and value my prior knowledge a lot more through this process &#8212; my MA in English literature can, after all, help me learn and appreciate math. You should respect and value your prior knowledge, too! If you ever feel stumped by a new topic, I encourage you to seek out ways to connect it to other topics that you already know a lot about.

For example, here&#8217;s a way to connect pi to basically the best female rocker of all time, Kate Bush:
