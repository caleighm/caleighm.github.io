Guess who graduated this week?!

No, not me&#8230;

_**Millie!**_

She successfully finished Obedience Level 2 at a local dog training facility.

That&#8217;s basically theÂ elementary schoolÂ of dog training &#8212;Â &#8220;So it&#8217;s not a big deal,&#8221; you might conclude.

But you would be _wrong._

For Millie, this is basically her PhD in Dog.

I adopted Millie from the [Kingston Humane Society](http://kingstonhumanesociety.ca/) when she was somewhere between 8-12 months old. Little did I know that she had pretty severe [dog reactivity](https://positively.com/victorias-blog/choice-training-working-with-a-leash-reactive-dog/).

This actually stems from fear and lack of confidence, not aggression, but it has been a long journey to get to the point where we can happily finish a group obedience class together (sure, she had maybe 3-4 minor meltdowns per class, but she&#8217;d pull herself together again after 10 seconds or so each time &#8212; and it was only ever if one of the other dogs started it, so I don&#8217;t think she wasÂ that bad).

So Millie and I are pretty pleased with ourselves!

Millie&#8217;s training saga got me thinking a lot about what dog and human learning has in common.Â For example, with both dogs and humans, we often approach learning all wrong:

  * We expect dogs to learn things on our terms, not theirs, and consider using dog-friendly motivators like treats as &#8216;bribery&#8217; &#8212; while we also fail to connect what we&#8217;re trying to learn with our own personal goals and dreams.
  * We frighten dogs into avoiding the wrong behaviour (e.g. jumping up)Â as opposed to teachingÂ dogs to choose the right behaviour (e.g. sit nicely) &#8212; while we are also terrified of failure, experimentation and learning from mistakes in our own education.
  * We get frustrated and angry when our dogs don&#8217;t perform as expected &#8212; and we get frustrated and angry atÂ the teacher, course, or other circumstances when things don&#8217;t go as planned.

With my own dog, Millie, I&#8217;m committed to using scientifically-sound and humane training methods &#8212; namely positive reinforcement only, lots of regular treats, praise and happy voices, no punishment or fear required. It&#8217;s worked out pretty well for us so far.

But this blog isn&#8217;t about dog-training &#8212; it&#8217;s about how people learn! Here are a few tips I&#8217;ve picked up for my own studies after working with Millie for the past 4 months.

### Milk what motivates me

Homework can be a real bummer. It&#8217;s demoralizing when I can&#8217;t figure it out, it often takes way more time than I thought it would, and there are always other, way more fun things I might be doing instead. When I&#8217;m teaching Millie a new behaviour, I have to consider what&#8217;s most motivating to her. (In this order: 1. Small furry moving prey. 2. The smelliest, meatiest treats. 3. Praise from me (_a distant, distant 3rd&#8230;_).

So what motivates _me_? What do I love? Delicious food. Going out with friends. What do I want to do when I graduate? A fun, challenging job. My choice of where to live. Working for a cause I believe in.

With this in mind, I&#8217;m careful never to work for too long without deciding on a fun reward, something to look forward to, at the end. I also keep my eye on the big picture when I&#8217;m feeling drained. Countdowns help &#8212; university terms are quite short (12-14 weeks), as is the degree itself in the long run. I like to purposefully choose these rewards and schedule them proactively so that I can see them coming up in the calendar.

Millie isn&#8217;t a machine; she needs to know what&#8217;s in it for her when it comes to training. Same goes for me and math homework.

# Treat practice problems like play

Currently I&#8217;m blasting through [Khan Academy&#8217;s Integral Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/integral-calculus) section. As a recovering perfectionist, I take it pretty personally when I&#8217;m on my _n_thÂ practice problem and still getting most of them wrong. I have to keep reminding myself that these practice problems aren&#8217;t final exams, nobody is judging me, and it&#8217;s only by getting these wrong, staying lighthearted about it, and learning from the experience that I&#8217;ll actually learn the concepts.

Traditional dog training keeps the dog so scared of making a mistake, they&#8217;re afraid to do anything at all. These dogs seem well-behaved on the surface since they&#8217;re so calm and docile, but in fact they&#8217;re often pretty stressed. Dogs trained with positive methods burst with enthusiasm and good behaviours &#8212; you can tell they are having a blast as they zoom around the agility ring, for example. The way to get dogs like this? Reward good behavioursÂ andÂ treat every training session like a game!

IÂ focus so much on my mistakesÂ that IÂ fail to notice my success, which means I often feel stressed and tired about my homework before I even start. That doesn&#8217;t feel good, and it also means I&#8217;m more likely to procrastinate doing the work.Â I&#8217;m trying to flip this dynamic &#8212; focus on what&#8217;s good, what am I doing right, andÂ use that information to do better next time at the hard problems. My hope is that one day I&#8217;ll treat homework as a fun experiment without any fear of messing up.

# Avoid the blame game

I hear a lot of dog owners say things like, &#8220;Well, my dog is just so stupid he could never&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;My dog is so stubborn she could never &#8230;&#8221; I also hear students (and myself!) blaming the course, the teacher, the circumstances, etc. when things go wrong &#8212; a failed test, misunderstood homework assignment, bad grade.

What&#8217;s the use in that?

This isn&#8217;t to say that courses, teachers, and circumstances are never to blame for bad outcomes. Of course they are &#8212; sometimes. But most of the time, those elements are out of our control &#8212; in the same way that our dogs&#8217; temperaments, histories and genetics are out of our control, too. I think those feelings of bitterness and blame only bring ourselves down without improving the situation at all. It might bring a short-term relief because the outcome is no longer my fault, but now I have to carry those negative feelings around with me. Gross!

Better, I think, to take responsibility for the parts that are in our control &#8212; &#8220;My reinforcement timing was off with the dog at that point,&#8221; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think to check in with the teaching assistant before handing in the assignment&#8221; &#8212; and then just let go of the rest. Move on. Know better for next time.

All easier said than done, I know. Don&#8217;t blame me! ðŸ˜‰
