This will eventually become my full-time home on the web! Hooray for no longer paying hosting fees!

# Todo:
* Use modal windows to display larger versions of the photos on Projects page
* Restore WP comments
* Restore categories and tags
* Create search function?
* ... Blog more, obviously

# Origins
I originally found this design when looking at the Phantom Jekyll theme created
by [Jami Gibbs](http://jamigibbs.com), then realized the theme demo was actually
a screenshot of her current site -- not the theme called Phantom!

So thanks, Jami, for allowing me to modify your gorgeous design :)
