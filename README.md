I originally found this layout when looking at the Phantom Jekyll theme created
by [Jami Gibbs](http://jamigibbs.com), then realized the theme demo was actually
a screenshot of her current site -- not the theme called Phantom!

I'm modifying it substantially to work as the homepage for a blog, but the
look, feel, and a lot of the work is from Jami Gibbs.
